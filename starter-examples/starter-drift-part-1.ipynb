    "# Guided Exercise: Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "You are the principal data scientist working for a new startup that offers a price recommendation for rental home listings. Your beach-head market was San Francisco and this was where you trained the model, which is the core service of the business. But now, the startup is looking to expand into Seattle and Austin. Using the mean price difference between San Francisco and each new city, you want to make sure your price recommendations don't drift. If they drift too low, your customers will leave money on the table; if they drift too high, their listing will be vacant. Hitting the goldilocks zone is critical for acquiring and keeping happy customers in Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitors in Seattle are within 65 dollars of the ideal price, and due to stiffer competition, competitors in Austin are within $40 of the ideal price. These are the benchmarks we need to hit to prove a viable product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals 🎯\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Set up and view the results of stability tests.\n",
    "2. Debug the true cause of stability issues.\n",
    "3. Retest the new model and confirm the effectivenesss of the mitigation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, set the credentials for your TruEra deployment.\n",
    "If you don't have credentials yet, get them instantly by signing up for the free open beta: https://app.truera.net"
